    port: 8000  # The port on which the service is exposed externally (or within the cluster). This will be the port that clients connect to.
    targetPort: 8000  # The port inside the container where the Flask app is actually running (as configured in the Docker container).
    nodePort: 30000  # llows you to access the service from outside the cluster by using a port on any of your cluster's nodes.

# Kubernetes will assign a port in the 30000-32767 range (if you donâ€™t manually specify nodePort).
# You can access the service using the IP of any node in your cluster (e.g., http://<node-ip>:30000),
# which will forward traffic to your Flask app running inside the container on port 8000.
